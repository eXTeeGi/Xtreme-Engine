# Xtreme-Engine

This is all the code I wrote for my 3D C++ game engine that I called "Xtreme Engine".
Xtreme Engine was university coursework. It requires dependencies that aren't public and are not mine to share.
Unfortunately, this means you won't be able to run it and use it yourself.
The code is here purely as a portfolio piece.
